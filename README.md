## MY FUTURE SCRIPTS

I plan on making alot of scripts, Even possibly my very own **FrameWork**, How fricking sick would that be ey?, But for now, We are starting off slow, But in this list is the following scripts i plan on making over the next couple years...

1. **Highly advanced garage script.** | *A script that lets players store their vehicles in FiveM*

2. **Highly advanced 24/7 robbery script.** | *A script that lets players rob 24/7 stores to recieve money*

3. **Legion square MLO.** | *A Custom building specifically that replaces the default GTA5 Legion Square MLO with something that makes it look more appealing and better!*

4. **Pedestrian robbery script.** | *A script that lets players rob pedestrians to recieve money or items for their self-benefit*
